# Distortion-SI
Code to perform semi-metric distortion thresholding (SDS) on networks and simulate SI dynamics.

Python scripts contain the needed functions to extract the semi-metric topology of networks (`semi_metric_topology.py`) and to simulate Susceptible-Infected dynamics (`si_dynamics.py`).

The jupyter notebook illustrate an example of application of our methodology to analyze SI outbreaks considering the mobility network of commuters in a real city.
