# Distortion-SI
Code to perform semi-metric distortion thresholding (SDS) on networks and simulate SI dynamics.

Python scripts contain the needed functions to extract the semi-metric topology of networks () and to simulate SI dynamics.

The jupyter notebook illustrate an example of application of our methodology to analyze SI outbreaks considering the mobility network of commuters in a real city.
